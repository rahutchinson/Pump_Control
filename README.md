##Pump Control
This repo if for a Reasearch project funded by NASA. The Texas Tech Enviromental Engineering Project is working on finding ways to reduce the amount of water on the International Space Station. 

### Program Description
This C# program was designed to control pumps that were being used to simulate water reclaming, urine, showers and other uses of water on the ISS. The research doctorate students were trying to run 24 and 48 hour tests and therefore had to wake up at insane hours of the night to come and physcially turn on/off the pumps. This program was designed to handle those on/off moments.
